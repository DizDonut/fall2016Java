Programming Challenge 


A car's miles-per-gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula:


MPG = Miles driven / Gallons of gas used


Write a program that will read a text file that contains the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas used by different car models. The program should calculate the car's miles-per-gallon and display the result on the screen. The program should also display the average miles per gallon. 



Process the file in such a way that it can handle a similarly formatted file that contains any number of customers. The text file should not be edited. Your program should be able to process the text file as is.
 

The text file contains the following:

Car type
Miles driven
Gas gallons

Text filename: MilesPerGallon
